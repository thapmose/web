## Machine Learning: Introduction
-----------------
Machine learning (ML) is a subset branch of artificial intelligence and it enable computers/machines to learn from the data and improve over time without a need of explicit programming. The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people. Algorithms employed in ML have the capacity to detect patterns in data and learn from them in order to make prediction, classificatin, clustering etc.

In general, traditional programming instructions are fed to the computer. These instruction informs the computer behavior given an input dataset. Primarily, `IF - THEN` structure is used to explicitly predetermine the action that ought to be taken by the computer.Machine learning, on the other hand, is an automated process that enables machines to solve problems with little or no human input, and take actions based on past observations.

While artificial intelligence and machine learning are often used interchangeably, they are two different concepts. AI is the broader concept – machines making decisions, learning new skills, and solving problems in a similar way to humans – whereas machine learning is a subset of AI that enables intelligent systems to autonomously learn new things from data.

## Machine Learning: Value Chain
-----------------
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the programing of ML algorithm is actually a small piece of the entire value chain of ML. There are other value-adding steps both before and after ML. Figure below gives a detailed breakdown of the ML value chain with examples.

## Machine Learning: Algorithms
-----------------
### Supervised learning
As the name suggests, in this types of Algorithms, the learning is supervised (i.e there is a presence of supervisor as a teacher).

This algorithms are trained on on a dataset that is well labelled. This imples that, the training data is already tagged with the correct answer. Once the traning has concluded, the machine is given a new set of data and produces the correct labelled.
### Unsupervised learning
This types of algorithms are trained on a data that is neither labelled or classified, allowing the machine to learn the patterns of the informations without any guidance. These algorithms, allw machines to sort and group unsorted data according to similarity, patterns, and differences without any prior knowledge (i.e for numerical data, machines can use statistical features to sort and group the data).
### Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is completely different from supervised and unsupervised learning as both operate on static data. These types of algorithms are intends to develop an agent that will take actions based on the observations from the environment. These actions are guided by the need to maximise the cummulative reward (optimal outcome). Reinforcement learning approches problem soving by allowing a software to explore, interact with and learn from the environment. Figure below gives graphical explanation of RL algorithms.

## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
-----------------
Given the intensive usage of jargon in this field, I have deemed it necessary to explicitly differentiate between Machine learning and Deep learning (DL). As previously described, ML learning enables computers to learn from data, whereas DL deplys comlex structure of algorithms modeled on the human brain to process the data with a logical and layered structure called Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Simply ut, Deep learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning which, in turn, is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. DL requires less human intervention as the algorithms are already developed like human brains. For example, using DL can enable automatic classification without an need for additional step called "feature extraction" that is generally necessary with other ML algorithm.
