## Artificial intelligence: Introduction
-----------------
To accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), executives in various sectors will be required to make decisive and informed decisions about where and how to employ these technologies in their businesses. This series of posts will give AI essentials to enable quick actions leveraging AI technologies.
## Artificial intelligence: A definition
--------------------------
Several definitions for Artificial Intelligence (AI) exist on the internet. In general, AI can be defined as the ability of a machine to mimic human intelligence to perform cognitive functions that can be associated with human minds. These cognitive functions include, but are not limited to, perceiving, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.

## Artificial intelligence: A brief history
--------------------------
A convergence of algorithmic advances, data proliferation, and tremendous increases in computing power and storage has propelled AI from hype to reality [1].

#### 1805 – Legendre lays the groundwork for machine learning
#### 1958 – Rosenblatt develops the first self-learning algorithm
#### 1965 – Birth of deep learning
#### 1986 – Backpropagation takes hold
#### 1989 – Birth of CNNs for image recognition
#### 1992 – Upgraded SVMs provide early natural-language-processing solution
#### 1997 – RNNs get a “memory,” positioning them to advance speech to text
#### 1998 – Brin and Page publish PageRank algorithm

## Artificial intelligence: Value Chain
--------------------------
The value chain of AI consists of four broad steps; (1) Data inputs, (2)Data management, (3) AI Technology, and (4) AI use case. The figure below gives a breakdown of these steps.

Evidently, Machine Learning is one of the key AI technologies. As the title reads "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning", I will deal with the theoretical and practical aspects of ML in a series of posts.
